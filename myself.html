    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Here is a quick overview about myself. I am originally from Michigan, that is where I grew up until moving to Texas a few years ago. That is also where much of my family is, though most of my family that I am still in contact with is in Germany, where my aunt and most of my cousins live.</p>
    <p>I have studied mechanical engineering for a couple years before deciding to change majors and univiersities, having becoming dissatisfied with the seemingly endless theory and no practical. Currently I am studying at Collin as a transition before going into UT Dallas for software engineering. </p>
    <p>I could put more in this and make it all look nice. However, I am currently lacking in inspiration and that is not the purpose of this exersize. Therefore this boring white page with black text will be the extent of my current efforts.</p>
